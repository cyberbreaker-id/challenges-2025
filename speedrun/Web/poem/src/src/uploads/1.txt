In a digital realm where shadows play,
Chasing flags, we search by night and day. 
Puzzles to solve, the thrill in the chase,
A mind's playground, a clever race. 

With each clue found, a victory sweet,
Unity blooms in challenges meet. 
Together we code, decode, and strive,
In the spirit of CTF, we thrive.
